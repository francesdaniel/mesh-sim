# 🧠 Mini RAG Bot Simulator – Mesh Network Onboarding Assistant

This is a foundational prototype of a user-facing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot. Built entirely using open-source tools, this bot is designed to assist users in understanding decentralized digital MESH networks — especially those headquartered in New York, but serving the broader United States.

> 🌐 The goal is to simplify organizational intuition, lower onboarding barriers, and propagate mesh network utility democratizing commons.

## 🚀 What It Does (Currently)

This version simulates a RAG system:
- Loads context from a static file (`context.txt`)
- Accepts a user question via terminal input
- Returns a "generated" answer by formatting your question with the context

No AI models, no internet required — lightweight by design.
